<!--
html ignores whitespaces & line breaks in the code. to render a new line or a whitespace, relevant tags are required

for line breaks add <br> or </br> tag.

There is not difference between both of them as <br/> is just a remnant of XHTML but works the same way as <br>

&nbsp; renders a single whitespace ;

for a straightline as well as a line break add <hr>
